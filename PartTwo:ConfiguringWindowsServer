In part one, we walked through the steps to spin up the initial Windows Server. Now we will configure a few settings before adding roles and features to the server, such as Active Directory.

You should see a similar screen as the one pictures below. Click on "Configure this Server". Find the option for "IE Enhanced Security Configuration" and choose off. This will make it easier to
browse the web on the project. It will stop the confirmation pop-up for every site you visit.

Now we need to add an internal NIC adapter. For this step we need to shut down the VM.
On the left side menu choose Network, then the Adapter 2 tab, check the box Enable Network Adapter and choose "Internal Network" from the "Attached to:" section. You can leave the name as-is for now.
What we just did was add a virtual Network Interface Card to the VM. This allows for data to traverse the network internally without reaching any external networks. This is important when we connect
a client to Active Directory.

Now we need to set a static IP for the internal NIC we just added.
Next, go into Settings and choose Network & Internet, then Change Adapter options.


Now, go back to the initial Server Manager > Dashboard screen, and choose "Add Roles and Features". Choose "Role-based or feature-based installation"
