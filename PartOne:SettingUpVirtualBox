Part One of this walk-through will guide you through the initial settings for launching an instance of Windows Server 2019 
running in VirtualBox. 

Click on "New" and it will allow you to choose the critera for the VM.
(insert screenshot)

Choose a desired name for the VM. Along with the a folder to save the contents.
You can visit (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2019) to obtain the free ISO for this project. The ISO is an evalution copy of
Windows Server 2019 which lasts only 180 days.
Make sure to choose the "desktop experience" option from the "Editions" drop down menu. Either standard or datacenter options are fine.

Next would be to choose the Username and Password for administration log-in.
Also your going to need to choose a domain name. Choose something that you can remember, this is only a lab and can (and should) be redone for practice.

In the Hardware section, choose the appropriate amount of RAM for the project. I use 2GB of RAM and is always sufficient for this.
Then going to the last settings options, I always choose 30GB of hard disk space and is always sufficient.

After you create the VM it will take approximatelt 5-10 minutes to spin up.
