In part one, we walked through the steps to spin up the initial Windows Server. Now we will configure a few settings before adding roles and features to the server, such as Active Directory.

You should see a similar screen as the one pictures below. Click on "Configure this Server". Find the option for "IE Enhanced Security Configuration" and choose off. This will make it easier to
browse the web on the project. It will stop the confirmation pop-up for every site you visit.

Now we need to add an internal NIC adapter. For this step we need to shut down the VM.
On the left side menu choose Network, then the Adapter 2 tab, check the box Enable Network Adapter and choose "Internal Network" from the "Attached to:" section. You can leave the name as-is for now.
What we just did was add a virtual Network Interface Card to the VM. This allows for data to traverse the network internally without reaching any external networks. This is important when we connect
a client to Active Directory.

Now we need to set a static IP for the internal NIC we just added.
Next, go into Settings and choose Network & Internet, then Change Adapter options.
Right click on Ethernet 2 and click "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)". This will allow us to set a static IP for this domain controller for the intneral
network. From there click properties and click the "Use the following IP address" and type in 172.16.0.1 for the IP address and 255.255.255.0 for the subnet mask
(I will be making another tutorial explaining the significance of IP addresses and their roles. The last thing we need to configure is the DNS server.
Choose the option to input your own DNS and choose 127.0.0.1 for this. 127.0.0.1 is what is known as a loopback address, it points back to the machine your using.

Finally before we install the Active Directory role on this server, let's rename the NIC's so it's easier for us to recongnize later on.
To find out which one is the internal NIC, double click and on one and click the "Details" button. It should look like the picture showed below. The NIC with the IP address of 172.16.0.1 rename "Internal".

Now, go back to the initial Server Manager > Dashboard screen, and choose "Add Roles and Features". Choose "Role-based or feature-based installation"
